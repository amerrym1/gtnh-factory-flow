/**
 * The push (docs/up-to.md, "The push"): every Up to card as high as it goes, fairly, once the trading is held. A
 * pool's level `u` is its machine time over its capacity, in 0..1.
 *
 * - Stage A, everything runs: the most the levels can add up to, S (old Build's first stage: a fed machine with
 *   somewhere to put its output never idles).
 * - Stage B, fairness: progressive max-min over the levels with their sum held at S (old Build's round-robin split).
 *   Each round lifts the least level z of the pools not yet frozen. A pool is frozen at z only when a probe proves it
 *   cannot go higher (its own level maximised with every unfrozen pool at least z; the round's candidates are first
 *   asked all at once, and freeze together when even their sum cannot rise); a pool some feasible point of the round
 *   already shows above z is a certificate that it can, and is not probed.
 * - Hold: each level is held in a narrow band (`Trades.floors`: from the level to `bandAbove` over it) through least
 *   flow, the canonical point and every later model of the support.
 *
 * The levels are a property of the plan, not of the solve path: stage A's optimum is unique, so is the max-min vector
 * over a convex set, and every freeze is decided by a value (a probe's optimum), never by which vertex an engine
 * returns. A probe holds the unfrozen pools at z itself, not z less a tolerance: room there would add up over many
 * pools and let a stuck pool look as if it rose. Work is counted, never timed.
