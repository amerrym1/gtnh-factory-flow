/**
 * The Library: everything you have, and everything the network has.
 *
 * It is not a tab and not a design. It sits at the head of the tab strip
 * as a "Library" pill, and like Welcome it COVERS the board rather than
 * replacing it, so nothing about the plan underneath is unmounted while it
 * is up.
 *
 * ALL is every design you have, one grid; a FOLDER is the same grid held to
 * one folder; PUBLIC is the network's setups.
 *
 * `active` and `view` live in sessionStorage: a reload while you are on the
 * library lands you back on it, on the same view, and a new visit starts on
 * whatever design was open. Same scope Welcome uses for the same reason.
