 * attempt to leave the notes unread lands here instead, with the warning's own
 * sentence on it - a reader who scrolled past that once is not going to be
 * persuaded by a reference to it.
 *
 * Exactly ONE speed bump, then out. Every exit gesture on this card - the
 * button, Escape, a click in the void - closes for real. Making any of them
 * loop back would turn a warning worth reading into a modal that will not shut,
 * and the second feeling is the one people remember.
 *
 * Not `window.confirm`: a native box over a blurred modal reads as the page
 * breaking, and it cannot show the sentence that matters.
