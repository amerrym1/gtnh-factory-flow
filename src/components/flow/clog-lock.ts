/**
 * Clog locks: machines frozen at 0% because their surpluses have nowhere to
 * go and every escape route runs through another jammed member.
 *
 * The death spiral's mirror image. A spiral STARVES: the loop loses material
 * every lap, winds down, and every card sits empty. A clog lock CHOKES: the
 * loop makes MORE of some good than it can swallow, the spare piles up until
 * every buffer is full, and then nobody can run because nobody has room. In
 * game the line freezes with every slot stuffed - full inputs, full outputs,
 * no progress arrow - and pulling a stack out by hand buys seconds before it
 * jams again. The solver's zeros are that end state, reached instantly.
 *
 * Detection is a proof, not a guess: the board is re-solved once with every
 * wired output port allowed to shed surplus at a cost (the vent solve in
 * equations-core). Machines that come alive in that world were stopped by
 * nothing but the surplus, and the vents the solve could not avoid name the
 * exact wires a drawer or trash can would rescue. A starving ring stays dead
 * in the vented world too, so the two detectors can never claim the same
 * machines.
