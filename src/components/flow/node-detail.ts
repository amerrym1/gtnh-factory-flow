/**
 * How much of the board is worth drawing at the current zoom.
 *
 * Zoomed out, a card's contents are noise, so past a threshold the board
 * switches to a glance view: machines show how hard they are running, buffers
 * show what is in them, and lines are just their routes.
 *
 * ONE level, held here, for nodes and edges alike: detail switching in pieces
 * reads as the board glitching.
 *
 * TUNING: where the glance view starts is the player's ("Zoomed-out view" in
 * the settings, `glanceEnterZoom`); it comes back a narrow gap above, because
 * a single boundary flickers when the board is parked on it. Keep the gap
 * narrow, or regaining detail means zooming noticeably further in than where
 * it was lost.
 *
 * Nothing here may change a node's SIZE. Detail is dropped with `visibility`,
 * never `display`, so every element keeps its layout box: the router measures
 * node bounds and slot anchors through those boxes, and a card that changed
 * shape with zoom would reroute the board every time you scrolled the wheel —
 * exactly the viewport-dependent routing CLAUDE.md forbids.
