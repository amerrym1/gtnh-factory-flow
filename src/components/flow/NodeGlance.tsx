/**
 * What a node shows once it is too small to read.
 *
 * Zoomed out, a card's contents are noise: the slot sprites are sub-pixel, the
 * dials are a grey smear, and the machine name is three pixels tall. The whole
 * interior stops being drawn (see node-detail.ts and the rules in globals.css)
 * and one of these takes its place — the single fact that still means something
 * at that size. For a machine that is how hard it is running; for a drawer, a
 * tank or a trash can it is what is in it.
 *
 * Two properties matter and are easy to lose:
 *
 * - It must not affect layout. Node size is a routing input, so a card that
 *   changed shape with zoom would reroute the board on every wheel tick. Hence
 *   `absolute inset-0`, and `display` rather than anything that reflows.
 * - It must fill whatever card it lands in. Cards range from a 132px drawer to
 *   a wide multiblock, so a fixed font size is either lost on one or overflows
 *   the other. The text is drawn in an SVG with a viewBox, which makes the
 *   browser scale it to the box for us — always as large as it can be, exactly.
 */

/*
 * The hop map paints this layer, and it does it in CSS.
 *
 * Hovering a card zoomed out floods the whole board with distance colours (see
 * hop-map.ts). None of that arrives as props: the map writes two custom
 * properties onto each node element and the rules in globals.css do the rest,
 * so a hover costs no React work at all on a board that may be carrying two
 * hundred cards. What that buys is why the glance layer takes no colour props
 * here — do not be tempted to "tidy" it into state.
 *
 * The paint lands on the glance layer and nowhere else, which is what keeps it
 * away from the board's geometry: that layer is `absolute inset-0`, it is only
 * displayed at the zoom step where the card's contents are already hidden, and
 * it has no say in the card's size. The router never sees it.
