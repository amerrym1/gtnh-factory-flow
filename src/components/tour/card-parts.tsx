/**
 * The look shared by the guided tour and the board's "?" corner.
 *
 * Both are the same idea - dim the screen, ring a thing, put a card beside it
 * saying what it is - so they are the same card. A row leads with the mark the
 * SCREEN uses: the button's own icon, a key chip, or a little mouse with the
 * right button lit, and the words that matter are lit rather than spelled out
 * at length. That is what stops either surface reading as a wall of text.
 *
 * The two differ in one thing only. The tour shows one card at a time and can
 * afford to shout, so its marks are cyan; the help sheet lays eight cards over
 * the whole window at once, where eight cyan cards would be a fairground, so it
 * passes a calmer accent in and keeps cyan for the one card you can click.
