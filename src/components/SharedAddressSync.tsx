 * Keeps the address bar honest about the open board.
 *
 * While the board is an untouched copy of a community post, the address
 * carries that post's share link - copying the URL bar IS copying the link.
 * The moment the board drifts from the post (one card moved, one wire drawn),
 * the id leaves the address, because a link that opens something other than
 * what the sender is looking at is worse than no link. Reset the board, or
 * share it so the post catches up, and the id returns on its own.
 *
 * Also empty for a copy that predates fingerprints (unchanged cannot be
 * proven), and for a post found deleted (see noteSharedPlanGone).
 *
 * Arrival is not read from the live address - shared-link.ts captured it at
 * load - so this sync can never race the import out of its parameter.
