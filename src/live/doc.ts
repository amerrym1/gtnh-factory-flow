 * A room's plan, kept so a batch costs what it touches, never the size of the

 * the room, written in place. `applyOps` (the shared engine) copies and
 * indexes every collection a batch touches; on a plan of tens of thousands of
 * things that is milliseconds a batch, and a scan per op was seconds.
 *
 * The results are exactly `applyOps`'s (doc.test.ts checks them against it):
 * a new thing is appended, a replaced or patched one keeps its place, a
 * deleted one leaves its place. Deletes leave a hole until enough gather to
 * be worth closing; holes never leave this class. Things are never changed in
 * place (a patch writes a copy), so a plan handed out by `toPlan` stays as it
 * was whatever happens to the doc afterwards.
